## Structure

This a backend API project.

It is built on top of FastAPI. [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/)

PIPENV is used for python dependencies and environment

The structure is the following:

- [application.py](http://application.py) - It is the main application file, here it is defined the base of the application and the registration of blueprints
- app - main folder of the application
    
    ### Explanation
    
    - Endpoint folders always have the following structure
        - __init__.py where it creates the endpoint as a blueprint and imports the route file
        - [routes.py](http://routes.py) where the routes are defined with the logic that each does, if itâ€™s more complex logic it should have its on file
        - other folder/files can exist to remove complex logic from the [routes.py](http://routes.py)
    - agents - main folder of the agents endpoint
    - llmTools - main folder of the tools endpoint
    - main - folder for anything that is mandatory and necessary
    - tests - folder for tests
    - tools - folder for generic tools that can be used across the project
    - auth - folder for everything that is auth wise, API_KEY
